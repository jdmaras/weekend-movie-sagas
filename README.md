# Weekend at the Movies 

I was given a database that had a couple of different tables in it. This was the first time really using a junction table so I was being tested on how to grab the table information from the DB to display on the DOM. This was also a great test of using SAGAs to get a detail view of all the movies I would be displaying from the database. 

## Description
The use of useParams to directly link to a query grab from the database was really neat when it all worked out. Learning a new technology and then getting to see how much easier it is to do something with the use of it was awesome. 

This project was also one of the few times I spent doing some styling. I had never done any kind of hover effects, so I spent some time putting a nice fade in and out on the landing page to show your cursor was over a certain movie.
